- India drew inspiration for its Fundamental Rights from the US Bill of Rights and the Magna Carta.
- The incorporation of Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution was intended to provide a sense of security and confidence to the diverse Indian society, which is fragmented into various religious, cultural, and linguistic groups.

- The Fundamental Rights (FR) in India serve two main purposes:
  - Guaranteeing certain basic civil rights and freedoms to all.
  - Providing safeguards to minorities, protecting religious freedom, and cultural rights.


- The FR is an integral part of the Basic structure of the Constitution.

- The Indian Constitution classifies fundamental rights into seven categories:
- Right to Equality (Art 14-18): Prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. Guarantees equal protection under the law and equal opportunities in public employment.

- The "State" includes:
  - Government and Parliament of India
  - Government and legislature of states
  - Local authorities
  - Other authorities within India or under the control of the Government of India.

- Local authority refers to a municipal committee, district board, or similar body entrusted with the control and management of a municipal or local fund.

- Examples of such laws include the Indian Penal Code, 1908, the Indian Contracts Act, 1872, and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

- The Doctrine of Severability and the Doctrine of Eclipse are legal principles used in the interpretation of statutes.
- The Doctrine of Severability allows courts to strike down a portion of a statute that is unconstitutional while leaving the rest of the statute intact.
- The Doctrine of Eclipse occurs when a new statute effectively replaces an older statute, rendering the older statute obsolete.
- In the case of The Prize Competitions Act of 1955, the court declared Section 2(d) of the Act to be void because it violated the fundamental right to carry on any business, trade, or profession.
- The court also found that the definition of competition under Section 2(d) was too broad and included acts that were not gambling in nature.

- Article 13(2) of the Indian Constitution prohibits the state from enacting laws that take away or limit the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.
- Any law made in violation of this provision is void to the extent of the contravention.

- Judicial review is the power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to declare the validity of a law.
- They can declare a law unconstitutional or invalid if it violates Fundamental Rights.
- Examples of recent judicial reviews in India include the Triple Talaq Judgment and the Adultery Judgment (Sec 497 of IPC).

1. **Socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs)** are groups of people who have been historically disadvantaged due to their caste, religion, or socioeconomic status. They face discrimination in education, employment, and other areas of life.

2. **The limit of reservation** for SEBCs in government jobs and educational institutions is 50%. This means that no more than 50% of the seats in these institutions can be reserved for SEBCs.

- Caste alone cannot be the sole test to determine backwardness.
- Merit alone can be the criterion for selecting students, especially in medical and engineering courses.

- The Supreme Court upheld the classification of backward classes based on castes.
- The government should not assume that backward classes will remain backward forever.
- If the government does so, it would defeat the purpose of reservation, which is to uplift backward classes.

- Carry forward rule is valid but permitted only in exceptional situations.
- The maximum reservation percentage is 50%.

- Shreya Singal vs Union of India: Involved Section 66 A of the Information Technology Act and online speech restrictions.

- Anuradha Bhasin vs Union of India (2020): Addressed the ban on internet usage.

**Issues Raised:**

- Issue 1: Whether the freedom of speech and expression, along with the freedom to practice a profession or engage in trade or business over the internet, falls under the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution.

- Issue 2: Whether the restrictions imposed violated the freedom of the press.

- The right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and the right to carry on any trade or business under 19(1)(g), using the medium of the internet is constitutionally protected.

- Individuals below 21 years should not be sentenced to imprisonment ordinarily.
- Rule of beneficial interpretation applied, punishment reduced.

- Article 20(2) of the Indian Constitution protects citizens from being prosecuted twice for the same offense.
- In Maqbool Hussain vs State of Bombay, the appellant was charged under the Sea Customs Act and later under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) for the same gold.
- The appellant argued that this violated Article 20(2) because he was being punished twice for the same offense.
- The court held that Article 20(2) did not apply because the customs authority that initially confiscated the gold was not a judicial body.

- Venkataraman was dismissed from service based on an inquiry under the Public Service Enquiry Act, 1960.
- Later, he was charged under the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act.
- He challenged this in court, arguing that it violated Article 20(2) of the Indian Constitution.
- The court held that disciplinary action and prosecution under the Prevention of Corruption Act are different, so Article 20(2) does not apply.

- Article 20(3) protects individuals from being forced to testify against themselves.
- This protection only applies when someone is compelled to give evidence.
- A confession statement given voluntarily in court is not covered by Article 20(3).
- In State of Bombay vs. Kathi Kalu Oghad, the Supreme Court held that the prosecution must determine if the accused gave information voluntarily or under compulsion.
- The Court also clarified that Section 27 of the Evidence Act does not violate Article 20(3).

- Nandhini Satpathi, former Chief Minister of Orissa, was asked to appear before the police for questioning in a corruption case.
- She refused to answer the questions, citing her right against self-incrimination.
- The police booked her under Section 179 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
- This case is often cited in discussions about self-incrimination and the right to remain silent.

- Nandini Satpathy had the right to remain silent during interrogation if her answers could lead to admitting guilt in the case under investigation or any other offense.
- The Supreme Court affirmed the accused's right to silence during interrogation.

- Accused individuals cannot be coerced or influenced into admitting their guilt.
- Accused individuals cannot be compelled to testify against themselves in a fair trial.
- Forcing suspects to sign statements of guilt violates the constitutional protection against self-incrimination.

- Narco-analysis, brain mapping, and lie detector tests against the will of the accused violate Article 20(3) of the Constitution.
- In India, the Narco-analysis test is conducted by a team of experts, including an anesthesiologist, psychiatrist, clinical/forensic psychologist, audio-videographer, and supporting nursing staff.

- Narco-analysis was first used in India in 2002 in the Godhra carnage case.
- Other notable cases where it was used include the Arun Bhatt kidnapping case in Gujarat, the Telgi stamp paper scam, and the Nithari village (Noida) serial killings.

- The use of narco-analysis, brain-mapping, and polygraph tests on accused, suspects, and witnesses without their consent is unconstitutional and violates the right to privacy.
- Compulsory administration of these techniques violates the right against self-incrimination.
- Test results obtained through compulsion cannot be admitted as evidence.
- Article 20(3) of the Constitution protects an individual's choice between speaking and remaining silent, regardless of whether the subsequent testimony is incriminating or exculpatory.

- Article 21 of the Indian Constitution protects the right to life and personal liberty.
- This right can only be deprived through a procedure established by law.
- The right to life is considered the most fundamental of all human rights.
- The right to life under Article 21 is supreme among all fundamental rights in the Indian Constitution.

- Indian judiciary interpreted words like "life," "personal liberty," and "procedure established by law" to protect fundamental rights.
- Liberal interpretation of right to life and personal liberty created new sub rights.
- Right to life is not absolute and the state can impose reasonable restrictions by following due process.

- "Procedure established by law" in Article 21 must be reasonable, fair, and just.
- It should not be arbitrary or unjust.

- In Kharak Singh v State of UP and Sunil Batra v Delhi Administration, the Supreme Court of India upheld the view of a US decision.
- In Francis Coralie Mullin v Union Territory of Delhi, the Supreme Court of India observed that the right to life includes the right to live with human dignity.

- The Supreme Court of India interpreted the term "Personal Liberty" narrowly in the case of A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (AIR 1950 SC 27).
- The court refused to accept a liberal interpretation of constitutional provisions.
- The court gave a narrow construction to words like "personal liberty" and "procedure established by law" used in Article 21 of the Constitution.
- The key issues in the case were:
  - Whether the Preventive Detention Act 1950 violated Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution.
  - Whether 'procedure established by law' under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution was the same as 'due process of law' under the US Constitution.
  - Whether there was any relation between Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution or they were independent in nature.

- The personal liberty guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution refers to the freedom from arrest and detention without legal authorization.

- The Supreme Court of India rejected a narrow interpretation of "personal liberty" in Kharak Singh v. State of UP.
- The court determined that "personal liberty" under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution encompassed more than just freedom from physical confinement; it encompassed all facets of liberty.

- In Maneka Gandhi v Union of India, the impounding of Maneka Gandhi's passport was challenged as a violation of her personal liberty.
- The authorities did not provide her with a hearing before impounding her passport.

1. The court considered whether Articles 21, 14, and 19 of the Indian Constitution are connected or mutually exclusive.


2. The court examined if Section 10(3)(c) of the Passport Act 1967 violates Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.


3. The court assessed whether the passport authority's power to impound or revoke an individual's passport is arbitrary.


4. The court evaluated if the "Right to travel abroad" is included within the ambit of Article 21 of the Constitution.


5. The court explored the scope of "procedure established by law" mentioned in Article 21 of the Constitution.


6. The court deliberated whether the term "law" in Article 21 of the Constitution can be interpreted to include the rules of natural justice.

- The Supreme Court expanded the definition of "personal liberty" and incorporated procedural due process into the "procedure established by law" phrase.
- Articles 21, 14, and 19 are interconnected.
- The "interest of sovereignty and integrity of the state" is not vague or erroneous under the Passport Act, therefore issue 2 is dismissed.

1. The right to go abroad is included in the personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.


2. The term "law" in Article 21 encompasses not only enacted laws but also principles of natural justice.


3. Any law prescribed under the "procedure established by law" must adhere to the principles of justice, fairness, and reasonableness.


4. The procedure for depriving an individual of personal liberty cannot be arbitrary, unfair, or unreasonable.

- Justice Krishna Iyer emphasized that the essence of Article 21 lies in protecting the spirit and dignity of an individual. Personal liberty is fundamental to the value of human life.

- The "Golden Triangle Test" established by the court ensures that any law restricting an individual's liberty must comply with not only Article 21 but also Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression) of the Indian constitution.

- The decision in Maneka Gandhi v Union of India led to courts recognizing new personal freedoms.
- These freedoms include the right to privacy, education, die, speedy trial, bail, appeal, humane treatment in prison, freedom from torture, live with basic human dignity, compensation for victims, and a clean and healthy environment.

- Article 21A was added to the Indian Constitution in 2002, guaranteeing free and compulsory education for children between the ages of six and fourteen as a Fundamental Right.


- The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act was passed in 2009 and became effective on April 1, 2010.

- Education provides individuals with human dignity.
- The Indian Constitution, under Article 45, mandates the state to strive towards free and compulsory education for children up to the age of fourteen within ten years from its commencement.

- The goal was to eliminate illiteracy from the country.
- The 86th Amendment in 2002 added Article 51 A(k) as a fundamental duty.
- Two relevant court cases are Mohini Jain vs State of Karnataka (AIR 1992 SC 1858) and Unnikrishnan vs State of AP (1993) 1 SC 645.

- Mohini Jain vs State of Karnataka (1992):
  - Petitioner challenged whether education is a fundamental right under Article 21.
  - Petitioner denied admission due to high capitation fee.
  - Court held that charging capitation fee is illegal.
  - Right to education flows from Article 21.

- The Supreme Court ruled in Unnikrishnan vs State of AP that the right to education is free and compulsory only for children between the ages of 6 and 14.
- This decision differed from the previous ruling in Mohini Jain, which held that children of all ages have the right to education.
- The Supreme Court's decision led to the creation of the 86th Amendment Act in 2002, which enshrined the right to education for children between the ages of 6 and 14 in the Indian Constitution.

- Article 22 of the Indian Constitution safeguards individuals against arbitrary arrest and detention.
- It establishes specific conditions and procedures that law enforcement authorities must adhere to when arresting and detaining individuals.
- Protection against arrest and detention is a fundamental right guaranteed to all citizens of India.
- Article 22 ensures that individuals cannot be arrested or detained without a valid legal basis or justification.
- It also mandates that individuals be informed of the reasons for their arrest and be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours of their arrest.
